You grew up around here?
WILL
Not far from here, South Boston.
SKYLAR
How was that?
WILL
Pretty boring, I guess.
She smiles.
SKYLAR
I bet you have a great family.
WILL
You know, nothing special.
SKYLAR
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
WILL
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
SKYLAR
Yeah.
WILL
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
SKYLAR
How many?
WILL
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
SKYLAR
What, five? Seven? Come on.
WILL
I have twelve big brothers.
SKYLAR
Not a chance.
WILL
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
SKYLAR
Bullshit.
WILL
I swear to God.
SKYLAR
Your house must have been a zoo.

                         I know why you're here. Will don't 
                         talk much.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't care what his family's like 
                         or if he doesn't have any brothers, 
                         but he doesn't have to lie to me.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I really don't know what to say. 
                         Look, I lie to women all the time. 
                         That's just my way.
                         Last week Morgan brought these girls 
                         down from Roslindale. I told them I 
                         was a cosmonaut. They believed me. 
                         But Will's not usually like that--

                                     MAN ON PORCH
                         Put some clothes on, Sullivan!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Take it easy father!


                                     CHUCKIE
                         All I can say is; I known Will a 
                         long time -- And I seen him with 
                         every girl he's ever been with. But 
                         I've never seen him like this before, 
                         ever with anyone, like how he is 
                         with you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is that true?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, it is.

                         Will, what happened at the Tri-tech 
                         meeting?

                                     WILL
                         I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. 
                         So I sent my chief negotiator.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, on your own time, you can do 
                         what you like. When I set up a 
                         meeting, with my associates, and you 
                         don't show up it reflects poorly on 
                         me.

                                     WILL
                         Then don't set up any more meetings.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'll cancel every meeting right now.
                         I'll give you a job myself. I just 
                         wanted you to see what was out there.

                                     WILL
                         Maybe I don't want to spend my life 
                         sittin' around and explaining shit 
                         to people.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The least you can do is show me a 
                         little appreciation.

                                     WILL
                         You know how fuckin' easy this is to 
                         me? This is a joke!
                         And I'm sorry you can't do this. I 
                         really am. 'Cause if you could I 
                         wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble 
                         around and fuck it up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sure, then you'd have more time to 
                         sit around and get drunk. Think of 
                         how many fights you could have been 
                         in by now.

                         So what'd I think?  I'm holdin' out 
                         for somethin' better. I figure I'll 
                         eliminate the middle man. Why not 
                         just shoot my buddy, take his job 
                         and give it to his sworn enemy, hike 
                         up gas prices, bomb a village, club 
                         a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and 
                         join the National Guard? Christ, I 
                         could be elected President.

                         Do you have a soul-mate?

                                     WILL
                         Define that.

                         Someone who challenges you in every 
                         way.  Who takes you places, opens 
                         things up for you. A soul-mate.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

                         Not to me, they're not.

                         That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll 
                         never have that kind of relationship 
                         in a world where you're afraid to 
                         take the first step because all you're 
                         seeing are the negative things that 
                         might happen ten miles down the road.

                         Oh, what? You're going to take the 
                         professor's side on this?

                         And here I am for the second week in 
                         a row with my professional reputation

                         Ready to falsify documents because

                         away from this.

                         I know what I'm doing and I know why 
                         I'm here!

                         a rapport with the boy -- I don't 
                         care if you have a few laughs -- 
                         even at my expense! But don't you

                         He has a gift and with that gift 
                         comes responsibility. And you don't 
                         understand that he's at a fragile 
                         point--

                         that he is better off as a janitor 
                         or in jail or hanging around with--

                         Why do you think he does that, Gerry?

                         He can handle the work, he can handle 
                         the pressure and he's obviously

                         Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because 
                         the first thing that happened to him 
                         was that he was abandoned by the 
                         people who were supposed to love him 
                         the most!

                         And why does he hang out with his 
                         friends? Because any one of those 
                         kids would come in here and take a 
                         bat to your head if he asked them 
                         to. It's called loyalty!
